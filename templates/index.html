        <h2>The Entrance Hall</h2>
        <p>You find yourself in the grand entrance hall of the Manor of Shadow. The heavy oak door behind you has locked itself, and the only way out is forward.</p>
        <p>Dark portraits line the walls, their eyes seeming to follow your every move. A cold draft whispers through the corridor ahead.</p>
        <p>Are you ready to begin your escape?</p>
